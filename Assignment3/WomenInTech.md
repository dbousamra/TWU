Why are there so few women in computer science and the IT industry?
===================================================================

I think this is a very tough question with many factors involved. I want to touch on a few of the things that I think contribute to fact that there are so few women in tech.

####Perhaps IT is viewed as male-oriented, this might contribute to low numbers of women:

I think that because IT/Technology is viewed as male oriented, turns some women away. During high-school early uni, perhaps there is a stigma associated with tech as being too male dominated and nerdy. I don't think there is an obvious way to fix this aspect, besides actually having statistically healthy number of women. If this were the case, perhaps more women would consider IT as a career.

####Pockets of sexism DO exist within the industry:

Thankfully this is a trend on it's way out and people are taking notice and voicing their opinions. I'm talking specifically about subtle/casual sexism towards women in the form of things like "Booth babes", and casual objectification of women in a professional setting. I think some people (both male and female) would see these things as a non-issue, and perhaps one day they might exist without issue, but at the moment, in my opinion these types of views of women in a professional context, do inhibit the industry presence of women. No one wants there gender to be stereotyped that way, and I think women are turned off the industry as a whole because of it. As I said above, thankfully people are realising this is not a healthy, or appropriate way to portray a gender.

####That because IT/Tech is such a new industry it hasn't gained the recognition or stature it needs to lure women into roles:

The technology industry in it's current form (especially software) is between 20 and 40 years old, with only the last 20 having seen standardized/formalized computing roles become commonplace. I think it's possible that people still view the industry with some mystique and incredibility that might once have been associated with things like medicine (a long time ago). People don't always understand the roles people perform in these industries, and immediately dismiss them. I think this goes for men and women both, but the reason I think it may contribute more strongly to the lack of women in tech, is that traditional gender roles are enforced during childhood too. In turn, because many girls may not have been exposed to computers as much as boys had, they never understood the industry at even a basic level. I don't think it's a highly responsible factor, but I think in time, as IT matures, naturally more and more people (and women) will see it as a viable career.
