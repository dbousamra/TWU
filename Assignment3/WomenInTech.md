Why are there so few women in computer science and the IT industry?
===================================================================

I think this is a very tough question with many factors involved. I want to touch on a few of the things that I think contribute to fact that there are so few women in tech.

####Perhaps IT is viewed as male-oriented, this might contribute to low numbers of women:

I think that because IT/Technology is viewed as male oriented, turns some women away. During high-school early uni, perhaps there is a stigma associated with tech as being too male dominated and nerdy. I don't think there is an obvious way to fix this aspect, besides actually having statistically healthy number of women. If this were the case, perhaps more women would consider IT as a career.

####Pockets of sexism DO exist within the industry:

Thankfully this is a trend on it's way out and people are taking notice and voicing their opinions. I'm talking specifically about subtle/casual sexism towards women in the form of things like "Booth babes", and casual objectification of women in a professional setting.
