Gini Coefficient - low or high?
-------------------------------

The Gini Coefficient is a useful tool to quickly glean some understanding of a societies wealth status. It can quickly show you the level of inequality in a country. 

I think in general a society is obviously better off if the economic Gini coefficient is lower (i.e. a greater proportion of the population controls a greater percentage of the assets), but that a closer analysis is needed. As a general rule, a society is said to have a high level of inequality with a Gini Coefficient of 0.50 to 0.70. A society with a low level of inequality typically has a Gini coefficient of 0.20 to 0.30. 

Both extremes however, have issues. A country with a high Gini coefficient is subject to several risks as a society:

- Rich have incentive to preserve money and not invest in forward progress.
- Inefficient allocation of private resources and assets.
- Social unrest
- And the biggest disadvantage being that it is unfair, and unethical for a government to advantage any class at the expense of another.

A country with a very low Gini coefficient (0.10 to 0.20) also faces several issues including:

- A low incentive to invest and innovate as personal reward is negated, and no reward on risk.
- Placing too much emphasis on letting a government improve the country.

Most societies with extremely low Gini coefficients have been communist or socialist in policy. 

It seems looking at various resources that countries struggle to maintain very low Gini coefficients (note, not low levels of inequality, just low levels of Gini coefficient) for very long without facing societal issues. In summary, I think that using the Gini coefficient on it's own is perhaps a poor metric. A country should strive to have the lowest economic inequality possible and promote opportunity equality, but that there are many factors that need to be considered to avoid the pifalls that can occur when very low economic Gini coefficients are present.
