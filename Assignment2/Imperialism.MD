1.) In the linked maps, I was amazed at the graphical depictions of various country metrics. In particular the amount of money the US spends annualy on military operations is amazing. I imagine that a great deal of the nations workforce is tied up in weapons and defense manufacturer and production. Given this fact, I am wonderying  how many of the foreign policies since this increased military spending (i.e. since the end of WW2 and the start of the Cold War) have been influenced heavily by the workforce requirements, and not wanting to increase unemployment rates.

3.) The article "Conversation with Madhusree Mukerjee" by Gene Santoro was very interesting. In my school days I wasn't taught much about the British empires relationship with India. If it was mentioned at all, Churchill was regarded as a gentleman leader. From the article it's clear his view of India was classicaly Imperialist, and irrational. I'm not sure I can confidently answer which side India should have been on in World War II. From my understanding of the situation I think they were on the right side already. They didn't have the economic or military power to combat the Allied forces, nor was it worth damaging a healthy (if somehwat one sided) alliance. However if they were to side with the Axis, their geographical position may have provided a solid base of attack for the Japanese and German troops into Southeast Asia.
